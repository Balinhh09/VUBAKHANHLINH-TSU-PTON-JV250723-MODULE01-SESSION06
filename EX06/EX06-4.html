            <b>This is the first item's accordion body.</b> It is shown by default, 
            until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we 
            use to style each element. These classes control the overall 
            appearance, as well as the showing and hiding ví CSS transitions. 
            You can modify and of this with custom CSS or overriding our 
            default variables. It's also worth noting thát just about any HTML 
            can go within the <span class="first-item-link">.accordion-body</span>, 
            though the transition does limit overflow.
